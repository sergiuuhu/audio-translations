Back to the drawing board 
OK, let’s go back to the drawing board and design a new one.
To brainstorm an idea 
Hi everyone, in this meeting we’re going to brainstorm ideas for this year’s new product. Please feel free to share any ideas you have.
Give the green light 
We can’t start the project until management gives the green light.
Kick off 
As soon as we kick off the project, we will be very busy.
To think outside the box 
For our new advertising campaign, we really had to think outside of the box to come up with something that hadn’t been done before.
Fifty-fifty 
Since I’m as busy as you are, let’s split the work for this project fifty-fifty.
Get the ball rolling 
For our meeting today, Allie will get the ball rolling by talking about our budget goals for this quarter.
Get off the ground 
Months after looking into how to boost declining sales, we were finally able to get our aggressive sales campaign off the ground.
Hit the ground running 
We really need to hit the ground running with this idea and get our product on the shelves before someone else does.
Thanks for the warm welcome. I'm excited to join the team and ready to hit the ground running. Is there anything specific I should focus on first?
We have a tight deadline on this project, so we need everyone to hit the ground running from day one. No time for a slow start.
Corner the market 
In only a short time, the company has been able to corner the high-definition television market.
Our new product has unique features that can help us corner the market. Let's strategize on how to position it effectively against competitors.
I want our marketing team to come up with a campaign that will help us corner the market. We need to be the go-to brand in our industry.
Behind the scenes 
Organizing a roadshow may look easy, but do you have any idea how much hard work we’ve put in behind the scenes?
While the event is happening, we'll be working behind the scenes to ensure everything runs smoothly. Coordination is key to its success.
Our team is currently working behind the scenes to troubleshoot the server issue. We'll update everyone once it's resolved.
Knuckle down 
All right, quit joking around. We need to knuckle down and finish this report.
We have a lot of tasks to complete this week, so it's time to knuckle down and get to work. Let's meet our targets.
The deadline for the project is approaching. It's time to knuckle down and put in the extra effort to ensure a successful delivery.
Run around in circles 
The deadline is coming up, but we’ve been running around in circles because the client keeps changing their mind about the design.
I feel like I've been running around in circles trying to get the necessary approvals. The process needs to be more streamlined.
Let's avoid running around in circles. We need a clear plan and effective communication to move forward with the project.
Get up to speed 
It didn’t take me long to get up to speed with the new laws as my co-worker explained them to me perfectly.
I'm still getting up to speed on the current projects. Could someone fill me in on the latest developments?
We have a new software system in place, and it's essential for everyone to get up to speed with the new features. Training sessions will be scheduled.
To keep an eye on the ball 
When it comes to business negotiations, you really need to keep an eye on the ball.
In the upcoming negotiations, we need to keep an eye on the ball and not get distracted by side issues. Our main goal is to secure a favorable deal.
With multiple tasks on our plate, it's crucial to keep an eye on the ball and prioritize tasks that align with our project objectives.
Hands are tied 
Sorry, we have to extend the deadline. The client hasn’t returned my call yet and my hands are tied.
I understand your concerns, but my hands are tied regarding the budget. We'll have to work with the resources we currently have.
I'd like to approve the additional resources for your team, but unfortunately, my hands are tied due to the company's current financial constraints.
Go down the drain 
If this sales campaign doesn’t succeed, all our hard work will go down the drain.
If we don't fix the negative publicity issue soon, our brand reputation could go down the drain. Let's address it proactively.
We need to cut unnecessary expenses; otherwise, our profits could go down the drain. Let's review the budget and make adjustments.
By the book 
I don’t think John will listen to your suggestion. He insists on doing everything by the book.
Ensure all contracts are executed by the book to avoid any legal complications. We must adhere to the industry regulations.
The hiring process needs to be done strictly by the book. Let's follow the company policies and procedures to avoid any compliance issues.
Above board 
We only do things above board here. If you want a job, you need to apply like everyone else.
All financial transactions must be above board. We don't want any suspicion of irregularities during the audit.
Our negotiations with the new partner need to be above board. Transparency is crucial to building a trusting business relationship.
To cut corners 
The company cut corners when making their camera, so it’s very cheap but it stops working after a few months of use.
We're on a tight schedule, but we can't afford to cut corners. Quality should not be compromised for the sake of speed.
I understand the deadline is approaching, but cutting corners in the development process may lead to future issues. Let's stick to the established standards.
Put a plan into action 
If we put this plan into action, we may need more time and more people.
We've discussed the marketing strategy long enough. It's time to put the plan into action. Assign tasks and let's get started.
The restructuring plan has been finalized. Now, it's time to put it into action. Communicate the changes to the team and ensure a smooth transition.
Plan ahead 
The project manager’s advice is to plan ahead so that the project will go smoothly.
Let's plan ahead for the upcoming client meeting. Ensure all materials are prepared, and everyone is briefed on the agenda.
To stay ahead in the market, we need to plan ahead for new product launches. Research market trends and competitor strategies.
Make a plan 
How should we advertise this new product? Let’s make a plan now.
We need to address the issues raised in the last performance review. Let's make a plan for professional development and improvement.
Expanding into new markets requires careful consideration. Let's make a plan that outlines the steps needed for a successful market entry.
Stick to the plan 
Changing the design now will take too much time. Let’s just stick to the plan.
We've outlined the project timeline. It's crucial that everyone sticks to the plan to ensure we meet our deadlines and deliver on time.
During the event, unexpected issues may arise. But as much as possible, let's stick to the plan to provide a seamless experience for attendees.
Review the plan 
If we want to include all these new ideas, we will need to review the plan.
Periodically, we should review the project plan and make necessary adjustments based on the progress and any unforeseen challenges.
Market conditions are dynamic. It's essential to review the business plan regularly and adapt strategies based on the latest trends.
Tasked with 
Your team has been tasked with finding out why there are so many customer complaints.
I've been tasked with preparing the quarterly financial report. I'll ensure it's thorough and submitted before the deadline.
Each team has been tasked with specific responsibilities for the upcoming product launch. Let's collaborate to ensure a successful launch.
Outsource a task 
Since the project team is busy, it might be a good idea to outsource some tasks to another company.
Given our limited in-house resources, we may need to outsource the task of software development. Let's explore reputable vendors.
Outsourcing the maintenance of our servers could be more cost-effective. Let's identify a reliable provider to handle that task.

We must target to complete phase 1 before the year-end holidays when most people will be on vacation.
We have set a target to complete the website redesign within the next three weeks. Everyone needs to be focused to meet this deadline.

The project team can expect a free lunch if they achieve the target this month.
Our quarterly sales target is ambitious, but with a strategic approach and collaboration, we can achieve the target. Let's push for those extra sales.
Each department has specific goals this quarter. Let's align our efforts to achieve the target and contribute to the overall success of the company.
Wrap up the project 
Okay, everyone, let’s check all the paperwork and clean up the project room, then we’ll be ready to wrap up the project.
The final phase is here. Let's ensure all loose ends are tied up, and we wrap up the project successfully. A comprehensive review is crucial.
It's been a challenging journey, but it's time to wrap up the project. Finalize documentation, gather feedback, and prepare for the project review meeting.
